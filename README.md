I added sound effects for each button that coincides with the message of the pet that pops up using .hide() and .show().
I also added an extra condition that if the dog's weight is = or < the original starting weight, a 'crying dog' sound effect
will play until the dog's weight is > than the original dog weight. Mood and happiness is overidden also.  All comments added
to the code.
